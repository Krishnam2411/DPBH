Check out our comprehensive guide to registering a unique and brandable domain for your online store.learn moreYou Purchased a Domain, Now What?Still confused on what to do after successfully registering your domain? Time to get your online store up and running. Follow these simple steps to get started.learn moreFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat is a domain name?A domain name is your online identity. It is unique to you as no two parties can have the same domain name. If you’re a local business, a blogger, or simply anyone who wants to get online, having a domain name is essential.
Why do you need a domain name?Domain names bring a sense of legitimacy to your brand. They provide a convenient option to access your website. In addition, using a simple, descriptive domain helps you stay on top of customer’s minds.
The branding benefits of domain names extend to your emails too. By getting a domain that matches your email, you show customers and partners that you are a professional and credible business.
What is domain name registration?Domain name registration is the process of reserving a domain on the Internet, usually for one year.
ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, manages the Domain Name System (DNS) and accredits registrars, like BigRock, to manage the reservation of domain names.
Now, a domain can be yours for more than a year if you renew it.
At BigRock, you’ll find several domain extensions at business-friendly prices. The longer you register your domain with us, the higher your discount.
What should I choose as my domain name?Your domain should be consistent with your website’s content. You can opt to use your brand to boost customer loyalty and recognition. For example, if the name of your company is ‘Acme Company’, then your domain can be acmecompany.com.
Another tactic is to include keywords. This is especially useful for blogs. Say you run a blog site for marketers, then your domain can be marketingguide.com.
It’s also a good idea to keep your domain name short (between 5–20 characters) for easy recall. Avoid using difficult phrases, numbers, and hyphens on your domain name.
When picking a domain extension, it’s a good idea to see if a .com domain is available first. If not, try other popular TLDs like .org, .net, or .biz. If you are promoting your business locally, consider getting a ccTLD.
Why should I keep my domain name registered?Once you get a domain name, keep tabs on the expiry date so you don’t lose it. Failure to renew could result in you totally losing your website.
Domain names can only be registered for a year so you should remember your expiry date and renew it at least two weeks before the expiration date. If you lose your domain name, your registrar will reclaim it and make it available to the public.
It’s good practice to keep all your information updated, including the billing and administrative contacts. Also, update your contacts including your email address and number.
Notifications for renewals and price changes will be sent to the registered email addresses. Missing out on such emails could put you at risk of losing your domain name. Make sure to maintain the email addresses that you’ve used upon registration.
How do I register a domain?There are five (5) steps to follow when registering a Domain Name:
Search for a domain name of your choice
If the domain name is available, select the registration term, and provide your contact details and DNS information.
Review the information and ensure the data is correct.
Tick the box to agree to the Service Agreement.
Provide payment information and submit your request.
Can I register more than one domain name at a time?Yes, your online domain purchase list can have unlimited domain names.
I don't have a website; can I still register a domain name?Yes. You don’t need to have an existing website to register a domain name. You can purchase a domain name any time.
How much time do I need to wait after requesting for the registration of my domain name?Once you have registered and made the payment for your domain name, it’s reserved immediately and will not be available for anyone else to purchase. The domain name will then be technically available within 24–72 hours.
How would I know if I have registered a domain name successfully?You will receive a confirmation email that will confirm your registration details, customer ID, login information, and other important details.
How can I make changes to my domain name?You can manage your domain name by clicking the link in your email. You can log in using your domain registration username and password to make changes. You will then be able to make changes such as editing the contact details and other necessary actions.
Can I modify the DNS server information?Yes. After registering your domain name, you can edit your DNS server information from Orderbox under the Manage Domain Names option. Then select modify name server details and enter your new nameserver details.
Is web hosting included in my domain name registration?No, web hosting is not included. You will need to purchase a web hosting plan separately to get your domain up and running.
What is a subdomain?A subdomain is a subdivision of a larger domain. For example, blog.mycompany.com is a subdomain of mycompany.com. A subdomain is used to direct a visitor to a specific part of your site.

What is domain name privacy?
Domain name privacy, also known as WHOIS privacy or privacy protection, is a service offered by domain registrars to protect the personal information of the domain owner. When you register a domain, your contact details (such as name, address, email, and phone number) are recorded in the WHOIS database, which is publicly accessible.
Domain name privacy works by substituting your personal details with information from the registrar or a privacy service. This shields you from spam, unsolicited messages, identity theft, and privacy worries. Meanwhile, your domain stays active and functional.

How has Bigrock made domain transfer easy?
With Big Rock, domain transfer is no more a hassle or a tedious task. However, before you begin with the process, you are required to confirm –
If your domain can be transferred
If you require to obtain a Domain (Transfer) Secret or Authorization Code for your domain name before placing a Transfer request.
Once the Registrant Contact approves the email and the Domain (Transfer) Secret Key/Authorization Code is submitted, the Current Registrar will automatically be notified about the transfer. Now, the Current Registrar will send the e-mail to the concerned domain name’s Registrar Contact to confirm if they wish to transfer the domain name. And, if the transfer is not denied by either of them, it will be transferred to you in the next 5 days under Bigrock.
How much do domains cost & how to purchase a domain with SSL?
Depending on the TLD and the domain name you choose, the domain price starts from ₹99/year and may go up to ₹3098/year. You can get a .com domain at just ₹799/year. To leverage the maximum advantage of an effective domain name, it is highly recommended to go for a premium domain name.
Now, coming to the second part of the question, you can apply for an SSL Certificate by logging in to your control panel as your first step. Thereafter, navigate to the Order Information View. Herein, type your Domain name in the search field on the homepage, select ‘Order’ from the drop-down menu and click on Search. Lastly, submit your certificate application by navigating to the SSL Certification section and clicking on Issue Certificate in the order information view.
Now, enter your CSR and click on Next. On the next page, choose a verification method and proceed with the verification of your domain by following the steps mentioned there. Thereafter, you are all set to install your SSL certificate.
