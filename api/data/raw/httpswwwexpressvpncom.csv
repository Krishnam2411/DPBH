A VPN, or virtual private network, is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. VPNs protect you from snooping, interference, and censorship.As you connect to a secure VPN server, your internet traffic goes through an encrypted tunnel that nobody can see intoâincluding hackers, governments, and your internet service provider.Try ExpressVPN Risk-FreeHow do I get and use a VPN?Step 1Sign up for ExpressVPNVisit the order page and select the option thatâs right for you.

ExpressVPNâs performance is great. Consistently good speeds.The best offshore VPN for privacy.ExpressVPN is the best VPN service weâve tested.Benefits and advantages of VPNChange your locationUsing a VPN changes your IP address, the unique number that identifies you and where you are in the world. A new IP address makes it harder to determine your identity and real location. With ExpressVPN, you can appear to be in the UK, U.S., Canada, Australia, or any of 105 countries.Protect your privacyChanging your IP address with a VPN helps shield your identity from websites, apps, and services that want to track you. Good VPNs also prevent your internet provider, mobile carrier, and anyone else who may be listening from seeing your activity, thanks to a layer of strong encryption.Increase your securityUsing a VPN protects you from security breaches in many forms, including packet sniffing, rogue Wi-Fi networks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Travelers, remote workers, and all kinds of on-the-go individuals use a VPN whenever theyâre on an untrusted network like free public Wi-Fi.Try ExpressVPN Risk-FreeWhen should I use a VPN?If privacy is important to you, you should use a VPN every time you connect to the internet. A VPN app runs in the background of your device so it wonât get in the way while you use other apps and browse the internet. And youâll have peace of mind knowing your privacy is always protected.But here are some situations in which a VPN is especially useful:While travelingExploring the world doesnât mean you have to change the way you use the internet. A VPN lets you use the internet as if you were still in your home country, no matter how far you travel.While having funA VPN lets you enjoy the sites and services you like without ISP throttling that could detract from your experience or outright blocking by your ISP or local Wi-Fi network.While on public Wi-FiConnecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots like those in cafes, airports, and parks could leave your private information vulnerable. Using a VPN on your devices keeps you safe with strong encryption.While gamingUsing a VPN unlocks games, maps, skins, and other add-ons that might be restricted on your network. It also shields you from DDoS attacks and reduces ping and overall lag.While file-sharingP2P file sharing usually means that strangers can see your IP address and possibly track your downloads. A VPN keeps your IP address private, letting you download with increased anonymity.While shoppingSome online stores show different prices to people in different countries. With a VPN, you can find the best deals in the world no matter where youâre shopping from.How does a VPN work?To understand how a VPN works, it helps to first understand how your internet connection works without one.Without a VPNWhen you access a website without a VPN, you are being connected to that site through your internet service provider, or ISP. The ISP assigns you a unique IP address that can be used to identify you to the website. Because your ISP is handling and directing all your traffic, it can see which websites you visit. And your activity can be linked to you by that unique IP address.With a VPNWhen you connect to the internet with a VPN, the VPN app on your device (also called a VPN client) establishes a secure connection with a VPN server. Your traffic still passes through your ISP, but your ISP can no longer read it or see its final destination. The websites you visit can no longer see your original IP address, only the IP address of the VPN server, which is shared by many other users and changes regularly.Click to connectNot ConnectedConnected
Here are several key concepts related to VPN that will help you understand how a VPN works and the benefits it provides:ProxyingThe VPN server acts like a proxy, or stand-in, for your web activity: Instead of your real IP address and location, websites you visit will only see the IP address and location of the VPN server.This makes you more anonymous on the internet.AuthenticationEstablishing a secure connection is a tricky problem solved by clever mathematics in a process called authentication.Once authenticated, the VPN client and VPN server can be sure they are talking to each other and no one else.TunnelingVPNs also protect the connection between client and server with tunneling and encryption.Tunneling is a process by which each data packet is encapsulated inside another data packet. This makes it harder for third parties to read in transit.EncryptionData inside the tunnel is also encrypted in such a way that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This keeps the contents of your internet traffic completely private. Even your internet service provider wonât see it.Learn more about VPN encryption.Try ExpressVPN Risk-FreeVPN protocolsVPN protocols are the methods by which your device connects to the VPN server. Some protocols are better for speed, some are better for security, and some simply work better under certain network conditions.Most VPNs use a standard set of protocols, but ExpressVPN built Lightway to outdo them all in speed, reliability, and security. Give it a try to see for yourself. Learn more about Lightway.ExpressVPN automatically chooses the best protocol for your network, but you can also choose one manually.Popular VPN protocols in use today include:OpenVPNIKEv2L2TP / IPsec*PPTP*WireGuard*SSTP**Not supported by ExpressVPN.Types of VPNCommercial VPNA commercial VPN, also called a personal VPN or a consumer VPN, is a private service offered directly to individuals, usually for a fee.ExpressVPN is such a VPN service because it directly caters to the privacy needs of its customers.Corporate VPNA corporate VPN, also called a business VPN, allows an organizationâs remote employees to connect securely to the internet as if they were physically present in the office.Unlike commercial VPNs, however, corporate VPNs are meant to protect the privacy of the company and not necessarily the individual.Self-setup VPNSome tech experts and DIY hobbyists choose to set up their own VPN using their own equipment.Self-setup VPNs, however, do not provide the protection of shared IP addresses, server locations in multiple countries, or many other features enjoyed by commercial VPN users.Alternatives to VPNA VPN isnât the only tool that can increase your privacy, security, and/or freedom online.TorTor (short for The Onion Router) is a free network of servers, or ânodes,â that randomly route internet traffic between each other in order to obfuscate the origin of the data.Using Tor can significantly increase your anonymity, and using Tor in conjunction with a VPN creates the best possible privacy protection.The biggest drawback of Tor, however, is speed. Because your traffic is relayed through several hops, you will probably find it inconvenient to download or file-share with Tor.Proxy servicesA proxy server is any intermediary between your device and the internet. Unlike a VPN, however, most âproxy servicesâ youâll find are quite slow and donât offer any privacy or security benefits.So-called âfree proxy servicesâ are especially dangerous, as many will find other ways to monetize your data, like selling it to third parties.Neither Tor nor a proxy service can replace the benefits of a VPN. A trustworthy VPN is still the best privacy solution for most people.Get ExpressVPNFAQHow do I choose a VPN?The most important quality to consider when choosing a VPN service is trust. A trustworthy VPN provider:is transparent in its privacy policyhas been independently auditeddesigns its systems to avoid storing personal datashows a consistent commitment to internet privacy and digital freedomThereafter, choose your VPN based on the features you need, such as VPN server locations, compatibility with all the devices you own, and unlimited bandwidth.Why should I pay for a VPN?Itâs hard for a free VPN to match the features and service of a quality paid provider. With free VPNs, you are more likely to experience slow connections bogged down by a flood of users on suboptimal networks, no customer support, weak security, and a small number of VPN server locations to choose from.As a premium paid provider, ExpressVPN can offer connections optimized for speed, security, and stability, as well as a wide selection of server locations in 105 countries around the world. Plus, our dedicated Support Team is available 24/7 to help.Are VPNs legal?VPNs are legal, and they are consistently used by individuals and companies around the world to protect their private information and online activity, including in countries with highly restrictive governments. Even where VPNs are seen as discouraged, many governments tacitly endorse their use by officials, academics, or business leaders as a necessary measure to stay competitive in an interconnected world. It is not practical for any country to ban all VPNs.Having said that, illegal online activity remains illegal, whether you are using a VPN or not.Can I use a VPN on mobile? Why would I want to?With apps for iOS and Android, ExpressVPN is easy to use on mobile devices. As more of our digital activityâincluding banking, streaming, and messagingâhappens on our phones and tablets, it is becoming more important to safeguard our data with a VPN on these devices, especially when using public Wi-Fi.Will a VPN slow down my internet?VPNs have the potential to slow your internet connection, but ExpressVPNâs industry-leading speeds mean users rarely notice a difference. In fact, use of a VPN may actually improve your connection if your ISP has been throttling your traffic.In any case, if you do notice that your connection has slowed down, try selectingÂ a server location that is geographically closer to you.Do VPNs drain battery?Like all apps, a VPN will consume some amount of power on your device. Thatâs one reason ExpressVPN developed Lightway, our exclusive, custom-built new VPN protocol, which is designed to use significantly less battery than other protocols. Itâs also faster and easier to audit and maintain.Can you be tracked if you use a VPN?ExpressVPN believes everyone has a right to privacy. When you connect to our network, strong encryption prevents your activity from being observed by your internet provider, Wi-Fi operators, or other third parties. ExpressVPN collects no activity or connection logs, and our groundbreaking TrustedServer technology ensures that no data is ever stored on any server. In short, no specific network activity or behavior can be traced to any ExpressVPN user.Is using a VPN safe for online banking?Using a VPN is not only safe, it can add a valuable layer of security to your online banking, especially on public Wi-Fi networks. And because some financial institutions will suspend access to users who appear to be visiting from somewhere unexpected, connecting to a server location in your home country before you log in to your bank or PayPal account can save you from getting locked out.Should I leave my VPN on all the time?We recommend that you keep ExpressVPN on anytime your device is connected to the internet, even if youâre not actively using it. By leaving the app running in the background, youâll have peace of mind knowing that your privacy is always protected.Live, 24-hour customer supportReal support from real people.
