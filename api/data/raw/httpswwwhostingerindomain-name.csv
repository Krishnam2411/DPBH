It is how visitors will be able to locate your website.
Simply type a website or business name into Google's search field, and one of the top search results should be the website you're looking for. Hostinger.com, like Google.com  and Facebook.com, is a domain name.

Length. Keep it short; two to three words is ideal.
Simple. Donât use long or hard-to-spell words.
Keywords. Include a keyword from your industry. For example, if you sell soya beans in Dallas, try dallassoyabeans.com.
Avoid numbers. Numbers are hard to recall and make domains more complex.
Brand name. Include your brand name for maximum awareness.Can I Modify a Domain Name Once It Has Been Registered?No, once a web address is registered, it cannot be changed.

You should only type the words you wish to appear in the website name.How Do I Use the Domain Search to Check Domain Availability?Simply type your ideal web name into the domain name search bar at the top of the page to see whether it's available.

Examples of ccTLDs include .in, .de, .mx, and .fr. A gTLD, which refers to generic top-level domain, is the most commonly used type of domain name. This is because it includes popular domains like .com, which has more registrations than all the country-specific domains combined (ccTLDs).

It hides certain information about a domain name's owner that would otherwise be discoverable through a WHOIS lookup.
With domain privacy protection, you can substitute your name, address, phone number, email address, and business name with a set of generic, non-identifiable information to safeguard your privacy.Whatâs the Difference Between .com, .net, .org and .info?Each gTLD has a somewhat distinct meaning, so choose the one that is most applicable to your website.
.com domains are often used for commercial purposes, but they're increasingly being used by default since they convey a level of confidence.
Originally used by networking organizations such as internet service providers, .net domain names are now used for a variety of purposes. .org domains are mostly utilized as a gTLD for charities, communities, and local organizations, as they were intended. .info, on the other hand, is geared towards information-based websites like wikis and tutorials.
There is some wriggle area with all of these gTLDs. There's no regulation requiring you to use one name over another, and there's no test you must complete to register one. So instead of regulations, think of them as suggestions.Whatâs the Difference Between a Domain Name and Web Hosting?Your domain name is similar to your address, and your web hosting is similar to your home.
