Domain FAQWhat is a domain name and why do I need one?A domain name is what people type into a browser to find a website - similar to how you use a street address to find a building. Every website, server, or digital device that is connected to the Internet has an assigned IP address that you can use to see or visit it. This IP address is a long string of numbers and letters that would be very difficult for people to memorize, so a domain name is simply a human-friendly version of that IP address.
When you type a domain name - like www.godaddy.com or www.google.com - into your browser, the domain name system, or DNS, takes this domain and translates it into its IP address, allowing the associated website to be found.
Having your own domain name can help you appear more legitimate to people who search for you or your business online. With a domain name, you can:
Build a website for your storefront or ecommerce business
Create a professional email with your domain name
As the world’s leading registrar, GoDaddy can help you find the right domain name that suits your needs. You can use our search tool at the top of the page to check for domain name availability and, once you have your new domain name in hand, we can help you build and grow your online presence. At GoDaddy, we’ve got everything you need to succeed online - from web hosting services (that include free SSL certificates) to a Digital Marketing Suite that makes it easy for you to manage your social media, SEO, and more.

You technically don't own the domain, but once you've registered it, it's yours to use for as long as you continue paying the annual registration fee. If you let your domain registration lapse, the domain will become available for someone else to register. To help prevent accidental expiration, GoDaddy offers an auto-renew option for all customers.  For an extra layer of prevention, our Ultimate Domain Protection (an optional add-on) allows you to keep your domain for an additional 90 days after expiration.Domain name registration is the process of finding a web address (like GoDaddy.com or LilysBikes.com), and then signing up to use it.

Decide on a domain name extension. The extension (also known as a top-level domain or TLD) is the part at the end of the domain name — .net, .biz, .org or .com, for example. Many people choose to register their website name with more than one of these extensions, as a way to prevent other people from registering their brand name on those TLDs.
Think about what business name or specialty you'd like on the other side of the dot. Use our business name generator to get ideas and to help find the right one.
Type the domain you want into the search box at the top of this page. We'll tell you if that particular domain is available and also show you others you may like better.
Pick a domain (or several), add it to your cart, and check out. You are now the proud owner of your very own domain. As long as it's registered to you, no one else may use it.

How long does my domain name registration last? How do I renew my domain?The duration of your domain registration can vary depending on the domain extension you purchase. With most extensions, domain name registrars allow customers to register domains for up to 10 years at a time. Typically, customers register domains for one to three years. Some premium domains and gTLDs (like .au and .nl) have shorter registration periods.
If you want to extend your registration, it's easy to renew your domain with GoDaddy.

Reflect your brand. Ideally, your domain name should be your business name, since that's how customers will think of you.
Keep it short. Shorter domain names are easier for customers to remember.
Avoid numbers or hyphens. Customers might not remember to include hyphens, and if they hear your web address with a number, they won’t know if you’re using the numeral 5 or “five” spelled out. If your business name has a number in it, register both versions of the domain – one with the number and one with the number spelled out.
Register more than one domain. You can help keep your name safe by registering common misspellings of your brand name. If you already own your .com domain and misspellings of that domain, consider registration for other various domain extensions, such as .org, .net, .info, etc (see our full list of available gTLDs).
